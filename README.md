# Tobias Feltes

Full-Stack Software Engineer with a focus on JavaScript/TypeScript. Currently immersed in the exciting world of GPT-4 and the incredible possibilities it offers. I've recently joined [Friday Finance](https://fridayfinance.com/) as a Full Stack Engineer, working to develop innovative financial solutions.

My expertise spans front-end development with Vue, React and React Native, and back-end technologies such as Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. A decade-long journey in the music industry paved the way for a renewed passion for software development, inspired by the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the field.

As a firm believer in continuous learning, I thrive in collaborative environments where I can engage with like-minded individuals to innovate and solve complex challenges.
